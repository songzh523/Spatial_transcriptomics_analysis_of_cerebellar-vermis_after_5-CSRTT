# Spatial transcriptomics analysis of cerebellar vermis after five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT)

Here, we uncover a novel role for cerebellar granule cells (GCs) in regulating attention through lobule-specific circuitry and molecular pathways. 
Using spatial transcriptomic approaches, we show that GCs in the anterior and posterior cerebellum exhibit opposing activity patterns during attentional tasks.
What's more, spatial transcriptomics identified Tmem108 in anterior GCs and Grin1 in posterior GCs as key molecular regulators.
